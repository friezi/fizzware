v2.51:
- EOF caused an error, the program continued processing. Now the program exits cleanly.
- If saving of commands fails, an error-message is printed.

v2.52:
- builtin function sgn() returns now "1" for input "0"
- unary minus and plus can be used anywhere in the expression, not only at the beginning,
  that's why "a=-2" will work now

v2.54:
- due to scientific-mode output of floatingpoints, there was a syntaxcheck-problem while reading floatingpoints in
  scientific notation. This problem is fixed because there's no scientific-mode output anymore.
