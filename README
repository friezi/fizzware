make dist

Compile only the library:
cd classes
make

Call the editor defined in the environment-variable EDITOR with all the relevant sources:
cd <subdirectory>
make ed

Clean all addtitional binaries:
make clean

cd classes
make clean

Clean only documentation for fztooltempl:
cd classes
make cleandoc
