v1.94:
- MathExpression:
  - builtin function sgn() returns now "1" for input "0"
  - unary minus and plus can be used anywhere in the expression, not only at the beginning,
    that's why "a=-2" will work now

v1.95:
- namespace ds:
  - class BitMatrix
- MemPointer:
  - added operator!()

v1.96:
- added sections in PropertyReader
- classname PropertyReader::iterator changed to PropertyReader::properties_iterator
